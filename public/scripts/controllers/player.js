        songsOrIndex

            the queue controller calls it then it's the index of the queue array
            in the QueueService that contains all the queue songs. $scope.play() 
            will play the song in that specific index of the queue array. 
            
            If the function is called from the search controller then it's a song 
            object and this function will play it.

        queueOrSearch
          - This variable defines who called this function, 'q' refers for queue
            and 's' for search.
